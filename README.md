# Code Quiz

For the code quiz I made some generalizations about the target web site based on the information given. In my experience the content someone has on the page is usually what they want to use but they don't have it organized and functioning the way they want. So I used all the elements on the page to make a Meet the Team page and added a little more info. The entire page is mobile responsive.

## Ideas behind the design
1. I assumed the company was Martha's Vineyard base off the logo. I copied the logo in illustrator to make it sharper so I could have it be larger and more visible at the top of the page. I left room at the top of the page for navigation but not see a reason to include it in this layout.
2. Since I tried to use all of the current elements, underneath the logo is the line with the diamonds.
3. I cut out all the pictures and put them back on the page as individual photos, when you mouse over each one the card flips and reveals the bio on the back of each picture. I took some creative liberties with the names and about. I hope you enjoy this it was all in good humor.
4.I kept the dog photo and the quotes but placed them at the bottom. I was on the fence about removing them as they didn't seem to really tie in, however sticking with my original plan I wanted to use all the original elements and try my best to make them look good. I've had projects in the past were clients insisted on using certain graphical elements so I left them in.
5. Next to the join our team part at the bottom I added a quick form where if someone is interested they could send off some info. The form is not live at the moment.
6. I added the footer with some of the orignal color scheme with the logo.
